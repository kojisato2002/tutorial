I messed up tonightI lost another fightI still mess up but I'll just start againI keep falling downI keep on hitting the groundI always get up now to see what's nextBirds don't just flyThey fall down and get upNobody learns without getting it wonI won't give up, no I won't give inTill I reach the endAnd then I'll start againThough I'm on the leadI wanna try everythingI wanna try even though I could failI won't give up, no I won't give inTill I reach the endAnd then I'll start againNo I won't leaveI wanna try everythingI wanna try even though I could failOh oh try everything


Look how far you've come
You filled your heart with love
Baby you've done enough that cut your breath
Don't beat yourself up
Don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last but we did our best

I won't give up, no I won't give in
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again
Though I'm on the lead
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again
No I won't leave
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

I'll keep on making those new mistakes
I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes
Oh oh, try everything
